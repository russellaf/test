<p>While most Americans haven&rsquo;t heard of the &ldquo;program&rdquo; yet&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s available in all 50 states and is open to all Americans no matter their age or income level.</p>

<p>Now so we&rsquo;re clear&hellip;</p>

<p>These checks are <span style="background-color:yellow;"><strong class="bold"><u>NOT from Social Security</u></strong>,</span> annuity payments, reverse mortgages, or anything like that... <s> </s></p>

<p>In fact, this &ldquo;program&rdquo; has nothing to do with typical fixed income investments like insurance, annuities, or the bond market.</p>

<p>Instead, thanks to a longstanding partnership between the U.S. government and the private sector&hellip;</p>

<p>Americans of all ages have the opportunity to collect these monthly income checks.</p>

<p>In short, the president and his economic team have crafted the <strong><u>perfect</u></strong> opportunity to supersize your retirement income.</p>


<div class="floatContainer">
  <p>A little-known way for seniors to increase their monthly income by up to <strong><u>$6,189</u></strong>&hellip;

  </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really incredible&hellip;</p>

<p>Unlike government programs&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyone can start collecting this cash.</p>

<ul class="disc">
  <li><strong><u>Without</u></strong> having to wait until you&rsquo;re 62 years old to cash out&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong><u>Without</u></strong> having to pay in for 30 years to fully collect&hellip;</li>
  <li>And <strong><u>without</u></strong> affecting your Social Security status!</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong class="bold">That means you can collect both the income on this program&hellip;PLUS your Social Security checks!</strong> </u></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because &ldquo; The Presidential Retirement Program&rdquo; is funded by the private sector.</p>

<p>Please understand&hellip;if you&rsquo;re worried about running out of money during your retirement&hellip;</p>

<p>Or would simply like an easy way to supplement your Social Security income.</p>

<p>This could be the answer you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, this could be the biggest retirement breakthrough I&rsquo;ve seen in the last 20 years&hellip;</p>

<p>And we have the president to thank.</p>

<p>So pay attention&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span style="background:yellow;">Because in the next 60 seconds you&rsquo;ll discover the full details on this powerful &ldquo;retirement program.&rdquo;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Make no mistake&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>This is the story the mainstream media and Wall Street would prefer you never hear&hellip;</p>

<p>But thanks to <strong>the Office of Management and Budget</strong> &mdash;everything you&rsquo;re about to read is a matter of public record.</p>

<p>Already, the success stories I&rsquo;m hearing are astounding.</p>

<p id="gif1Trigger">Year after year...</p>

<p>But keep in mind&mdash;everything I&rsquo;m about to tell you can be verified in the government&rsquo;s <strong><em><u>own</u></em></strong> documents.</p>

<p>And of course with a program this good I&rsquo;m not the only one to notice&hellip;</p>

<p>Seniors from around the country are flooding into this type of retirement program.</p>

<p>According to the latest data, this &ldquo;retirement program&rdquo; is skyrocketing.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s about to get a whole lot bigger.</p>

<p>In fact, by 2030 it could be one of the biggest &ldquo;retirement programs&rdquo; in history.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Let me show you&hellip;</p>

<h3>Death of Social Security</h3>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Nilus Mattive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the well-known author of&hellip;</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_NilusBook.jpg" width="250px" />
<p>My work has also appeared in <em>Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, MarketWatch </em> and<em> </em>Fox News<em>&hellip;</em></p>

<p>But recently I&rsquo;ve taken a job with the largest independent financial research group in the entire world&mdash;to help spread my income-gushing ideas to people like you.</p>

<p>And for the last few months I&rsquo;ve been investigating a fascinating &ldquo;retirement program&rdquo; that has huge implications for Americans&hellip;</p>

<p>A program that could free seniors from the devastating reality of Social Security in the coming decades.</p>

<p>Because let&rsquo;s be real&hellip;just a quick glance at S.S.&rsquo;s balance sheets reveals it&rsquo;s in terrible trouble.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">In fact, according to the government&rsquo;s own numbers S.S. will be insolvent in just 17 years&hellip;</strong></p>

<p><img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-01.jpg" width="800px" /></p>

<p>In other words&hellip;</p>

<p>In less than 2 decades many of your friends and neighbors could be left penniless&hellip;</p>

<p>As incompetent government officials bankrupt Social Security&rsquo;s coffers and run it into the ground. <s> </s></p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s why this &ldquo;retirement program&rdquo; has generated so much interest&hellip;</p>

<p>It gives investors a viable option to increase their income no matter what happens to the current Social Security system.</p>

<p>Just listen to the story of Jimmy Rogers from Flagstaff, Arizona...</p>

<p>By all accounts he&rsquo;s a regular guy living out in the mountains.</p>


<div class="floatContainer">
  <p><strong class="bold">But thanks to this &ldquo;new program,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s banked close to <span class="red"><u>$65,000</u></span></strong>&hellip;

    <span class="red">*</span>The examples provided may not be representative of typical results. Your capital is at risk when
    you invest in securities &ndash; you can lose some or all of your money. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.
  </p>
</div>
</div>




<p>Think about that&hellip;</p>

<p>And now thanks to the president&rsquo;s latest proposal, Jimmy may NEVER need to depend on any government program!</p>

<p>Not a bad gain on a little-known &ldquo;program&rdquo; most have never heard of.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder&mdash;with these types of returns&mdash;that more and more seniors are turning to this program?</p>

<h3><strong>From Skeptic to Believer</strong></h3>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve got to admit...when I first heard about how the president&rsquo;s plan could supersize retirement I was incredibly skeptical.</p>

<p>You see, before I worked at Agora Financial, I was a Wall Street analyst and worked at Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This work had me collaborating with some of the top minds in finance and gave me a backstage pass to the inner workings of large commercial banks.</p>

<p>In other words, I&rsquo;ve been around Wall Street and seen what the &ldquo;retirement world&rdquo; has to offer&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold">So you can imagine my skepticism when I heard of a revolutionary way for seniors to collect regular checks from <span class="red"><u> $597-$6,189</u></span> for life. </strong></p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I did&hellip;</p>

<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>I took my research team and spent the last few months investigating this special situation&hellip;</li>
  <li>We combed through federal documents, crunched all the numbers and I even reached out to my high-level contacts in the financial world&hellip;</li>
  <li><strong class="bold">And what we discovered is going to blow you away!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While it&rsquo;s not commonly seen as a retirement program and has no government affiliation&hellip; we&rsquo;ve uncovered thousands of Americans who were already cashing in.</p>

<p>And like I said earlier, this has NO connection with Social Security&hellip;NONE!</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s fantastic, because frankly&hellip;</p>

<p>If the idea of completely depending on the government for your retirement makes you a little uneasy&hellip;I get it.</p>

<p>I HATE big government programs just as much as you.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the cool part of this program&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks to the president&rsquo;s policy paired with the private sector and his plan to revolutionize America&hellip;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s set to release trillions of dollars into the American economy, creating a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Americans to boost monthly income.</p>

<p>You see, that&rsquo;s why I call it &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s New Retirement Program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because as you&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>

<p>By simply &ldquo;enrolling&rdquo; in this program by February 11, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to collect monthly checks almost 5 times larger than a Social Security check.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll show you how this partnership works in a minute, but first I want to tell you how much money you can make&hellip;</p>

<h3>Most Lucrative Retirement &ldquo;Program&rdquo; Ever</h3>

<p>You see, although &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s New Program&rdquo; was designed to be a safe and secure form of income&hellip;</p>

<p>A simple way to collect $1,000, $2,000 and $6,000 a month...</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a little more ambitious, you can make quite a bit more money.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all up to you.</p>
<div class="back row">
<p>Take Jackie Eaton from Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a 67-year-old woman approaching retirement and needed a little more income.</p>


<div class="floatContainer">
<p><strong class="bold">And thanks to this program she&rsquo;s already cashed close to <em><u class="red">$400,000</u></em></strong>.

<p>Now her life is completely different&hellip;</p>

<p>With an extra $400,000 she no longer stresses about money&hellip;</p>

<p>And has actually set up an inheritance for her granddaughter.</p>
</div>

<p>Now of course this is an extreme example, but I tell you this to show you what&rsquo;s possible, even though we&rsquo;d never recommend you invest more than you are comfortable with.</p>

<p>Because the reality is Jackie&rsquo;s not alone&hellip;not by a long shot.</p>

<p>During the course of my research I&rsquo;ve heard from countless people just like her who&rsquo;ve earned astounding amounts of money using this program.</p>

<p>And he&rsquo;s just getting started&hellip;</p>

<p>Nathan uses all the income from this program to actually buy new stocks to really pump up his income.</p>
</div>

<p>Consider that&hellip;</p>

<p>Nathan has already earned the equivalent of two and a half years&rsquo; worth of Social Security.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just for starters.</p>

<p>I know this seems unbelievable, but that&rsquo;s the power of the president&rsquo;s unusual &ldquo;retirement program.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="row quote">

<p>But the good news is, taking action is incredibly easy.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no annoying government paperwork to fill out or long lines to stand in like an actual government program&hellip;</p>

<p>Really, all you&rsquo;ve got to do to get started is fill out a few simple forms to make an investment&hellip;it shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>But to make it easy&hellip; <s> </s></p>

<p>I went ahead and gathered all the information you need and put it into a groundbreaking report called: <strong> <em> Trump&rsquo;s New Social Security: How to Earn an Extra $597-$6,189 a Month in Income </em> </strong> <em>.</em></p>

<p>This is the no-nonsense guide to &ldquo;the president&rsquo;s new retirement program&rdquo;&mdash;it gives you everything you need to know to start collecting these checks.</p>

<h3>The President&rsquo;s Plan to Save America&rsquo;s Retirement</h3>

<p>Like I said earlier, my name is Nilus Mattive.</p>

<p>I live on the beach in Santa Barbara, CA, with my wife and daughter.</p>

<p>And although I began my career helping rich people get even richer...</p>

<p>My job at Agora Financial has me specializing in one thing&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold">Discovering New Income Strategies</strong></p>

<p>You see, over my nearly two-decade career I&rsquo;ve learned one powerful lesson about retirement:</p>

<p>You need income to survive.</p>

<p>If you want to guarantee you never run out of money, the most important thing you should focus on is increasing monthly income.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s what I do all day long&hellip;</p>

<p>Scour the markets for hidden ways to make more money.</p>

<p>This work has taken me all over the world and has me consulting with all sorts of experts in finance, government and banking.</p>

<p>Not to mention my work appearing in <em>Businessweek</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em> and Fox News&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve even written a well-known book that was later translated into Chinese and sold around the world.</p>

<p>But I can tell you with everything I&rsquo;ve done&hellip;</p>

<p>By far the most gratifying part of my job is hearing from everyday people who&rsquo;ve used my strategies to double, triple or even quadruple their monthly income.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what a few of my readers said:</p>

<div class="email-quote">
<p class="email-subhead">Alison B. and her husband</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waaay ahead! Thanks to you we earn $1,400 every single month! I&rsquo;m a retired nurse, and my husband was a career waiter...just average folks. I have earned nothing but profit from your picks. God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The extra income means that this 85-year-old retiree can sleep at night&hellip;I draw a monthly check and my portfolio still keeps getting BIGGER...&rdquo;</p>

<div class="email-quote">
<p class="email-subhead">George G., San Diego, CA</p>

<p>&ldquo;The extra money has helped me with our rising local taxes here in NY. I now know that there is a steady stream of income to pay those taxes and to pay for my beloved golf vacations to Florida and South Carolina. Please keep up the great work!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You could be next&hellip;</p>

<p>But only if you take action by February 11.</p>

<p>Now, of course, no investment is 100%, and naturally risk is inevitable. But I&rsquo;m convinced &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Retirement&rdquo; offers you a fantastic opportunity to boost your monthly income.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I put together a special report called: <strong> <em> Trump&rsquo;s New Social Security: How to Earn an Extra $597-$6,189 a Month in Income. </em> </strong></p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d like to send a copy of this report to you absolutely FREE!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll even cover the shipping cost to get it to your front doorstep.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you all the details on how to get your FREE copy in a minute&hellip;</p>

<p>But first let me show you how Trump&rsquo;s revolutionary program actually works&hellip;</p>

<h3><strong>&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Retirement&rdquo; Explained</strong></h3>

<p>In order to truly understand this breakthrough you first need to know Trump is NOT your typical politician&hellip;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s NOT some DC bureaucrat who depends on high taxes or costly government programs to get things done.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s a business guy&hellip;</p>

<p>Since his career began in 1963 he&rsquo;s built his reputation on efficiency and getting the most out of every dollar spent.</p>

<p>And in what could be the most cost effective &ldquo;retirement program&rdquo; ever&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold">Trump&rsquo;s helping monetize one of the largest expenses the government has&hellip;and is, in turn, transforming it into the retirement program of a lifetime, whether he intended it that way or not.</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain&hellip;</p>

<p>For decades now, anytime the government needed to hire private contractors they turned to the Government Service Agency (GSA)&hellip;</p>

<p>Whether the government needed a bridge built, a road fixed or new fiber optic line&hellip;the GSA hired the contractor for it.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">Last year alone $416 billion flowed through this organization.</strong></p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting&hellip;</p>

<p>In the old days, the GSA would take tax money and hire outside contractors, and that would be the end of it.</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-02.jpg" style="margin-top:-20px;" width="700px" />
<p>But thanks to public law 114-23&hellip;</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s negotiated a way for this money to start flowing through private industry&hellip;which opens up the door for everyday Americans to cash in and get a piece of the action.</p>

<p>In other words, as Donald Trump rebuilds America from the ground up and continues to fight for these policies&hellip;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;ll indirectly funnel trillions of dollars through a select group of American corporations...</p>

<p>And through a process of trickle-down economics&hellip;regular Americans can invest with these companies to boost their monthly incomes by $1,000, $2,000 or as much as $6,000.</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Diagram.png" style="margin-top:-20px; margin-bottom:-50px;" width="400px" />
<p>It&rsquo;s a win-win proposition&hellip;</p>

<p>Most Americans have no clue this possibility for outsized income checks even exists.</p>

<p>But after months of investigation, I&rsquo;ve identified dozens of companies that are offering opportunities for these checks...</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a small sample of the companies offering payouts...</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Table_001.jpg" width="700px" />
<p>And the results are stunning&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s new program&rdquo; can outperform Social Security by a staggering percent.</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-03.jpg" width="700px" />
<p>And things are about to get a whole lot better&hellip;</p>

<p>Trump is expected to expand funding that could greatly enhance this program and has earmarked $1 trillion for it&hellip;</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s only poised to grow from here.</p>
<img class="image-center" id="gif1" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_MOneyStack.png" width="750px" />
<p>Now of course no investment is guaranteed, and risk is inherent with any type of investing, so naturally this is no different&hellip;</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s a lot of money just waiting to be dispensed.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though&mdash;you need to take action by <strong>February 11.</strong></p>

<h3>How Much Will You Have the<br class="hidebr" />
Opportunity to Earn?</h3>

<p>But by now you&rsquo;re probably wondering &mdash; how big could your first check be?</p>

<p>Well, as you may have noticed, the checks vary quite a bit, from $434 all the way up to $39,674.</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s a good reason for that&hellip;</p>

<p>See, unlike Social Security, with &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s program,&rdquo; collecting income from the private sector means you&rsquo;re only limited by your own initiative.</p>

<p>By that I mean&hellip;if you&rsquo;re happy to collect $1,000, $2,000, $4,000 a month that&rsquo;s fine&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll show you how to do that.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">But if you&rsquo;re a little more ambitious and want to collect bigger income checks of $10,000, $15,000 or more&hellip;that&rsquo;s very doable too.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all up to you.</p>

<div class="row back">
<p>Consider the case of Brian Pillar...</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a 53-year-old man living just outside of Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p>And although he&rsquo;s a quiet guy that doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about money...</p>

<p><strong class="bold">He admitted he&rsquo;d actually made over <span class="red"><u> $60,000</u> </span>off this &lsquo;program.&rsquo;&rdquo; Now, of course this is a little extraordinary, and you should never invest more than you&rsquo;re comfortable with&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>But keep in mind, that&rsquo;s more than 3 1/2 years of typical Social Security returns.</p>
</div>

<p>Bottom line is&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold">With &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s New Social Security&rdquo; you&rsquo;re only limited by how much time, investment and effort you want to put in.</strong></p>
<img class="image-right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Report_001_TrumpSecret.jpg" width="275px" />
<p>And I&rsquo;ve put together a new report with all the details (including the charts and projections) on exactly how much you can expect to earn.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve got to warn you&hellip;</p>

<p>Due to the limited availability of our customer service team and in order to ensure you experience the highest quality service&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m only authorized to give out 467 copies of this report today.</p>

<p>And once they&rsquo;re gone&hellip;they&rsquo;re gone.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested, you need to act fast.</p>

<p>But the good news is&hellip;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the lucky few who get this groundbreaking report&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span style="background:yellow">You&rsquo;ll learn <strong><u>everything</u></strong> you need to know to start collecting these checks.</span></strong></p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;</p>

<p>Up until this point, I&rsquo;ve mainly focused on &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s New Social Security&rdquo; and the incredible kick-start it can give your monthly income.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">But what I haven&rsquo;t told you is that&rsquo;s just <u>one</u> of the ways I have to boost your monthly income...</strong></p>
<img class="image-right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_RichLifeLetter.jpg" width="275px" />
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;ve spent close to 20 years in this game.</p>

<p>And in that time, I&rsquo;ve developed an entire strategy dedicated to revealing hidden situations that present phenomenal income opportunities like these.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">I call it <em>The Rich Life Letter</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This monthly publication specializes in finding incredibly lucrative income streams unknown to most investors.</p>

<p>This work is my passion, and has taken me all over the country in search of the perfect opportunities&hellip;</p>

<p>In fact, in the last year alone, I&rsquo;ve sifted through thousands of annual reports, pored over countless balance sheets and traveled over 10,000 miles.</p>

<p>Grueling&hellip;?</p>

<p>Sometimes, yeah.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of work and diligence it takes to uncover exceptional opportunities like &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Retirement Program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said, I&rsquo;ve just created a report that gives you full details on this opportunity that I&rsquo;d love to send to you FREE.</p>

<p>But before I do, let me tell you about another fantastic opportunity for seniors to increase their income:</p>

<h3>Wall Street&rsquo;s Hidden Instant Income Strategy&hellip;Little-Known Trick to Quickly Collect Hundreds of Dollars From the Stock Market</h3>

<p>Right now, Americans are facing a retirement crisis...</p>

<p>With interest rates at historic lows, retirees are desperate to earn any kind of yield on their money.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">But lucky for you I&rsquo;ve discovered a little-known way to <u>instantly</u> collect hundreds or even thousands of dollars from the stock market&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>I call this technique Wall Street&rsquo;s Hidden Income Strategy.</p>

<p>Because as you&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>

<p>By simply typing in a series of 5-digit codes into your brokerage account&hellip;</p>

<p>You get the chance to instantly collect cash from some of America&rsquo;s top companies.</p>

</ul>

<p>And the neat part is&hellip;you can do this over and over again each and every month, as long as you&rsquo;d like.</p>

<p>This strategy is incredibly easy to get started and requires:</p>

<ul class="checkmark">
  <li>No experience</li>
  <li>No previous knowledge</li>
  <li>No computer skills</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, one of the primary things you have to know is the right code to punch into your computer, and bingo, the money practically arrives like magic.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably why <em>Wired</em> magazine wrote:</p>

<div class="row quote">
<p>&quot;The one chance, besides organized crime and lotto, for an everyday person to get rich.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Thanks to Wall Street&rsquo;s Hidden Income Strategy, thousands of Americans just like you have a source of income they can depend on.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s just a few I&rsquo;ve discovered:</p>

<div class="email-quote">
<p class="email-subhead">Peter Nash of San Francisco, CA&hellip;</p>

<p>Although he rides BMX bikes for fun&hellip;he&rsquo;s stumbled onto this secret and made $1,089 in August alone!</p>
</div>

<div class="email-quote">
<p class="email-subhead">Ron Simpson of Charlotte, North Carolina, loves it too. Here&rsquo;s what he said&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This simple transaction is fabulous! I call it supercharging my income. My best year I made $130,000.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Think about that&hellip;That&rsquo;s an average of over $10,833 in extra income every month!</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s an important point:</p>

<p>Unlike dividends, bond coupons or interest payments, you don&rsquo;t have to actually own the stock to get this money.</p>
<img class="image-right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Report_002_WallStreet.jpg" width="275px" />
<p>Instead, you&rsquo;re simply tapping into a little-known pool of money very few investors know even exists.</p>

<p>But that said...</p>

<p>This is not a gimmick or get-rich-quick scheme...</p>

<p>This is a safe and predictable strategy proven out over decades of real-life results.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve put together a report that explains exactly how you can start collecting these checks in no time.</p>

<p><strong class="bold">And I&rsquo;d like to send you a copy of this for FREE&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>But before I do, let me tell you about a few more income-producing strategies I&rsquo;ve discovered.</p>

<p>And one of my favorites is the&hellip;</p>

<h3>Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% &ldquo;Bank Account&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Right now, most Americans earn between .01 and 1% in their savings accounts&hellip;</p>

<p>In other words&hellip;Chump change.</p>

<p>But what if I told you there was a &ldquo;bank account&rdquo;&mdash;tailor made for Americans 59 &frac12; years or older...</p>

<p>That could boost your current interest rate to<strong> <u>12%?</u></strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m serious&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks to the &quot;Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988&quot; (TAMRA)&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold">Baby Boomers now have access to a banking loophole that can help you earn 160%-1,250% more money than traditional banks.</strong></p>

<p>These accounts are available in 49 states and offer retirees the chance to drastically outperform typical banks.</p>

<p>And while I get it...that 12% return might not sound like a big deal&hellip;</p>

<p>But when you compare the returns against a traditional bank&hellip;</p>

<p>The gains can be substantial.</p>

<p>For instance, if you put $20,000 into a typical bank right now that earns a .01% rate&hellip;</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-04.jpg" width="700px" />
<p>After 20 years you&rsquo;d be left with $20,403.</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos_1/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-05.jpg" width="700px" />
<p>Now compare that with a &ldquo;Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% Bank Account&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>That same $20,000 morphs into over $210,000.</p>

<p>Not a bad gain on an &ldquo;account&rdquo; that&rsquo;s contractually guaranteed and backed up by government agencies.</p>

<p>Now so we&rsquo;re clear&hellip;</p>

<p>This is not any type of CD, money market or T-bill.</p>

<p>Instead, this is an &ldquo;account&rdquo; that gives you complete access to your money.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</p>

<p>See, while &ldquo;Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% Bank Accounts&rdquo; were designed to accumulate cash&hellip;</p>

<p>They also come with a whole host of other financial benefits.</p>

<p>Namely&hellip;Tax-deferred status.</p>

<p>That means that&mdash;as long as you&rsquo;re over 59 &frac12; years of age&mdash;every penny you earn in these accounts is completely tax deferred.</p>
<img class="image-right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Report_003_BabyBoomers.jpg" width="275px" />
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s like the &ldquo;Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% Bank Account&rdquo; is half retirement plan and half savings account all rolled into one. So whether you&rsquo;re looking for steady guaranteed returns safe from the stock market&hellip; <s> </s></p>

<p>Or want to boost your returns compared to just about any type of bond available&hellip;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% Bank Account&rdquo; is a great alternative.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve written a brand-new report to show you how exactly to set up your own &ldquo;Baby Boomer&rsquo;s 12% Bank Account&rdquo;...</p>

<p>This is unlike anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen!</p>

<p>But how much does <strong><em>The Rich Life Letter </em></strong>cost?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you&hellip;but before we get to that, there&rsquo;s one more opportunity I think you should know about.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a secret way to take advantage of IPOs long before the general public ever hears about them&hellip;</p>

<h3>Getting Rich Off Wall Street&rsquo;s Pre-IPO Market</h3>
<img class="image-right" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TrumpSocialSecurity_1117_Report_004_GettingRich.jpg" width="275px" />


<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that Wall Street keeps all the best deals for itself.</p>

<p>Even so-called ground floor opportunities like IPOs (widely considered the easiest way to get rich) are watered-down versions of what Wall Street actually uses.</p>

<p>The truth is, by the time an opportunity hits the public, the big money has already been made.</p>

<p>Look at Facebook...</p>

<p>This was one of the great success stories in the IPO market&hellip;</p>

<p>Since its initial public offering in 2012 its share price has risen $132 and given investors a 347% gain!</p>

<p><strong class="bold"> If you&rsquo;d put $5,000 into this trade you could have walked away with over $22,000.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not bad&hellip;</p>

<p>But if you were an insider and privy to what&rsquo;s called a pre-IPO, you could have made much more than that&hellip;</p>

<p>Consider Peter Thiel&hellip;</p>

<p><strogn class="bold"> He used this pre-IPO strategy to turn a $500,000 investment into a $1 billion windfall.</strong></p>

<p>While the public was forced to settle for a 347% gain&hellip;he quietly secured an almost 20,000% gain.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s not alone&hellip;</p>

<p>When Google went public back in 2004, regular investors went crazy and snatched up their shares of its IPO.</p>

<p>In fact, investors who got in on day one are up over 1,000%.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good&hellip;</p>

<p>But compared to insiders like Ram Shriram those gains are nothing&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold"> Instead of waiting until the stock went public, Ram got in with a pre-IPO and turned a $150,000 investment into a $9 billion gain!</strong></p>

<p>Think about that&hellip;</p>

<p>By getting in before the crowd&hellip;he closed a 60,000% gain!</p>

<p>These are the types of gains that happen when you can get in on the early rounds of financing.</p>

<p>But the trouble is, up until recently&hellip; <s> </s></p>

<p>Unless you were an accredited investor&hellip;there was no way to get in on these types of deals.</p>

<p>But all that&rsquo;s changed&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks to a revolutionary class of investment&mdash;available right now on the New York Stock Exchange...</p>

<p><strong class="bold"> You can invest directly in specific pre-IPO opportunities just like this.</strong> </p>

<h3>I call this <strong><em>Wall Street&rsquo;s Pre-IPO Market&hellip;</em></strong></h3>

<p>Because as you&rsquo;ll see for the first time ever&hellip;</p>

<p>You can now bypass Wall Street&rsquo;s &ldquo;rules&rdquo;&mdash;and start cashing in on these deals&hellip;</p>

<p>Long before they&rsquo;re ever technically available to the general public.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to invest right alongside elite investors like Peter Thiel, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, this could be your chance.</p>

<p>But it gets better&hellip;</p>

<p>See, one of the cardinal rules of venture capital investing is to never invest all your money in one company.</p>

<p>That means spreading your capital out over 10 or 20 different firms.</p>

<p>But the trouble is, most investors don&rsquo;t have that kind of money.</p>

<p>But with &ldquo;Wall Street&rsquo;s Pre-IPO&rdquo;&hellip;you don&rsquo;t have to worry about that.</p>

<p>Since it&rsquo;s a publicly traded company, their risk is spread out over a variety of industries and sectors.</p>
<img class="image-center" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/RLL/Trump_Social_Security/RLL_TRumpSocialSecurity_1117_Graphs_001-06.jpg" width="700px" />
<p>That way you&rsquo;re protected from any one investment.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s my favorite part&hellip;</p>

<p><strong class="bold"> Besides giving you access to HUGE upside gains from pre-IPO opportunities with limited risk&hellip;</strong> </p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall Street&rsquo;s Pre-IPO&rdquo; also kicks out cash-gushing dividends&hellip;</p>

<p>How much money are we talking?</p>

<p>Well, if you look at standard companies, most issue dividends 4 times a year&hellip;</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;Wall Street Pre-IPO&rdquo; on the other hand&hellip;</p>

<p>Spits one out every single month plus additional supplemental dividends.</p>

<p>Add all those up and you&rsquo;re looking at a grand total of:</p>

<h3>14 Dividends a Year!</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, to date the dividend is 201% higher than the S&amp;P 500!</p>

<p>And it shows no sign of stopping&hellip;</p>
